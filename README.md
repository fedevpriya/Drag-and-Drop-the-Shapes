# Drag-and-Drop-the-Shapes

This project is a web application that allows users to drag and drop shapes on a canvas. It features a simple interface with several pre-defined shapes, including circles, squares, and triangles. Users can also create their own custom shapes by drawing them on the canvas using the mouse. The project uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to handle the drag and drop functionality, and provides an intuitive user experience for creating and manipulating shapes. The project is easily customizable and can be used as a starting point for creating more complex web applications with drag and drop functionality.
